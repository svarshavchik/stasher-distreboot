    <para>
      &distreboot; is a sample application written with the &stasher;
      <acronym>API</acronym>.
      &distreboot; gets installed on every node in a &stasher; object repository
      cluster. It coordinates an orderly reboot of all nodes in the object
      repository cluster, one node at a time. After each nodes reboots,
      rejoins the cluster, and resynchronizes with the &stasher; object
      repository, the next node begins rebooting.
    </para>

    <para>
      &distreboot; chooses the reboot order so that the current &stasher;
      master node gets rebooted last. As such, a distributed reboot will result
      in the &stasher; master node transitioning to a different node only
      once.
